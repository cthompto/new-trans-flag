      <p class="disc">“A few years ago I had a dream of a trans flag whose colors shifted as endlessly as its form in the wind. A version that spoke both to multiplicity and to the underlying system trans folks traverse. So, in mid 2020 I coded this 2D version, procedurally generated using JavaScript, this flag will infinitely change color in its horizontal bars. While the colors shift, the black and brown triangle portions stay the same, a gesture towards the need to center black and brown trans voices and experiences. The design draws from the original trans flag, the black trans flag by Raquel Willis, and the “Progress” pride flag by Daniel Quasar.”</p>
